Mock storefront for a coffee roasting company. Product structure is intended to make it easy to add more products as well as product types.

Written entirely in AngularJS to explore the use of many views in a Single Page Application. Components are designed to be abstract whenever possible so they can be reused and dynamic with the information presented.

Styling is done using SASS files that are structured to mirror the Angular/HTML components, making it easy to locate everything that effects that component.
